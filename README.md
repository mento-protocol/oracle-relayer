## Local Setup

1. Install the `gcloud` CLI

   ```sh
   # For macOS
   brew install google-cloud-sdk

   # For other systems, see https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install
   ```

1. Install trunk (one linter to rule them all)

   ```sh
   # For macOS
   brew install trunk-io

   # For other systems, see https://docs.trunk.io/check/usage
   ```

   Optionally, you can also install the [Trunk VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Trunk.io)

1. Install `jq` (used in a few shell scripts)

   ```sh
   # On macOS
   brew install jq

   # For other systems, see https://jqlang.github.io/jq/
   ```

1. Install Terraform

   ```sh
   # On macOS
   brew tap hashicorp/tap
   brew install hashicorp/tap/terraform

   # For other systems, see https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install
   ```

1. Run terraform setup script

   ```sh
   # Checks required permissions, provisions terraform providers, modules, and workspaces
   ./bin/set-up-terraform.sh
   ```

1. Set your local `gcloud` project:

   ```sh
   # Points your local gcloud config to the right project and caches values frequently used in shell scripts
   ./bin/get-project-vars.sh
   ```

1. Create a `infra/terraform.tfvars` file. This is like `.env` for Terraform:

   ```sh
   touch infra/terraform.tfvars
   # This file is `.gitignore`d to avoid accidentally leaking sensitive data
   ```

1. Add the following values to your `terraform.tfvars`:

   ```sh
   # Get it via `gcloud organizations list`
   org_id          = "<our-org-id>"

   # Get it via `gcloud billing accounts list` (pick the GmbH account)
   billing_account = "<our-billing-account-id>"

   # Get it via `gcloud secrets versions access latest --secret relayer-mnemonic-staging`
   # Note that the mnemonic is the same for both the staging and prod environments.
   # To fetch secrets, you'll need the `Secret Manager Secret Accessor` IAM role assigned to your Google Cloud Account
   relayer_mnemonic      = "<relayer-mnemonic>"
   ```

1. Verify that everything works

   ```sh
   # See if you can fetch staging logs of the relay cloud function
   npm run logs

   # See if you can fetch prod logs of the relay cloud function
   npm run logs:prod

   # Try running the function locally
   npm run dev

   # Fire a mock request against your local function
   npm test

   # See if you can manually trigger a relay on staging
   npm run test:staging

   # See if you can manually trigger a relay on production
   npm run test:prod
   ```

## Switching between Staging and Production environments

- Most dev scripts accept a `staging|prod` parameter, i.e.:
  - `./bin/test-deployed-function.sh staging`
  - `./bin/get-function-logs.sh prod`
  - `./bin/deploy-via-gcloud.sh staging`
- You can switch your terraform environment manually via `cd infra && terraform workspace select staging|prod`
  - There are also npm scripts that abstract this for convenience like `npm run deploy:staging`

## Running and testing the Cloud Function locally

- `npm install`
- `npm run dev` to start a local cloud function with hot reload
- `npm test` to call the local cloud function with a mocked `RelayRequested` pubsub event

## Debugging Local Problems

For most local `terraform` or `gcloud` problems, your first steps should always be to:

- Clear your cache via `npm run cache:clear`
- Re-run the Terraform setup script via `./bin/set-up-terraform.sh`

## npm tasks and dev scripts

- **Local Function Development**
  - `dev`: Starts a local server for the cloud function code (with hot-reloading via `nodemon`)
  - `start`: Starts a local server for the cloud function code (without hot-reloading)
  - `test`: Triggers a local cloud function server with a mocked PubSub event
- **Deploying and Destroying**
  - `deploy:function:staging`: Deploys the cloud function to staging (via `gcloud functions deploy`)
  - `deploy:function:prod`: Deploys the cloud function to production (via `gcloud functions deploy`)
  - `plan:staging`: Shorthand for running `terraform plan` in the `./infra` folder for staging
  - `plan:prod`: Shorthand for running `terraform plan` in the `./infra` folder for production
  - `deploy:staging`: Deploys full project to staging (via `terraform apply`)
  - `deploy:prod`: Deploys full project to production (via `terraform apply`)
  - `destroy:staging`: ðŸš¨ Destroys entire project on staging (via `terraform destroy`)
  - `destroy:prod`: ðŸš¨ Destroys entire project on production (via `terraform destroy`)
- **View Logs**
  - `logs`: Shorthand for fetching the staging cloud function logs from staging
  - `logs:url`: Shorthand for fetching the log explorer URL for the staging function
  - `logs:prod`: Get prod function logs
  - `logs:staging`: Get staging function logs
  - `logs:function:url:prod`: Get log explorer URL for prod function
  - `logs:function:url:staging`: Get log explorer URL for staging function
  - `logs:job`: Get scheduler job logs, requires a rate feed name argument, i.e. `npm run logs:job PHP/USD`
  - `logs:job:url`: Get scheduler job URL, requires a rate feed name argument, i.e. `npm run logs:job:url PHP/USD`
- **Manually triggering a relay**
  - `test:staging`: Triggers a relay on the staging cloud function manually, i.e. `npm run test:staging PHP/USD`
  - `test:prod`: Triggers a relay on the prod cloud function manually, i.e. `npm run test:prod PHP/USD`
- **General Helper & DX Scripts**
  - `cache:clear`: Clears local shell script cache and refresh it with current values
  - `generate:env`: Auto-generates/updates a local `.env` required by a locally running cloud function server
  - `todo`: Lists all `TODO:` comments
- **Shell Scripts**
  - `set-up-terraform.sh`: Checks required IAM permissions, provisions terraform providers, modules, and workspaces
  - `check-gcloud-login.sh`: Checks for Google Cloud login and application-default credentials.

## Updating the Cloud Function

You have two options to deploy the Cloud Function code, `terraform` or `gcloud` cli. Both are perfectly fine to use.

1. Via `terraform` by running `npm run deploy:[staging|prod]`
   - How? The npm task will:
     - Call `terraform apply` with the correct workspace which re-deploys the function with the latest code from your local machine
   - Pros
     - Keeps the terraform state clean
     - Same command for all changes, regardless of infra or cloud function code
   - Cons
     - Less familiar way of deploying cloud functions (if you're used to `gcloud functions deploy`)
     - Less log output
     - Slightly slower because `terraform apply` will always fetch the current state from the cloud storage bucket before deploying
2. Via `gcloud` by running `npm run deploy:function:[staging:prod]`
   - How? The npm task will:
     - Look up the service account used by the cloud function
     - Call `gcloud functions deploy` with the correct parameters
   - Pros
     - Familiar way of deploying cloud functions
     - More log output making deployment failures slightly faster to debug
     - Slightly faster because we're skipping the terraform state lookup
   - Cons
     - Will lead to inconsistent terraform state (because terraform is tracking the function source code and its version)
     - Different commands to remember when updating infra components vs cloud function source code
     - Will only work for updating a pre-existing cloud function's code, will fail for a first-time deploy
